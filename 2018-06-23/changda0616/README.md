Music player inspired by [Charles Patterson's work](https://dribbble.com/shots/4240318-Made-with-InVision-Studio-Music-Player) on Dribbble. At first glance, I think it won't be too hard to complete the cover, but actually spend me about two days to finish.


1. Toggle-able animation building with infinite animation play time.
     ( There must be a better solution ).

2. A hollow disk which can be elevated by shadow, used drop-shadow to achieve this property. While using box-shadow, the shadow which outside the disk will be cut, cuz mask-image property I use to create the disk shape.

3. Use clip-path to create the icon's animation, really enjoy using this tech. 

4.  Create a hallow disk shape with combining the  mask-image and the  radial-gradient. I think this can save tons of works if needing more complicate shapes.

That's what I learn and use in this session.
